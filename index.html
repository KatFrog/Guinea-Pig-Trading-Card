			<p>Guinea pigs belong to the rodent family, and were domesticated as early as 5,000 BC.  Sadly, there are not good records from that time period, so we don't know a more precise date.  Guinea pigs sport a variety of colors (e.g. brown, tan, white, black) and fur that is either very short or very long, but every guinea pig's face has a common look with large eyes on the side and sharp teeth in front.</p>
